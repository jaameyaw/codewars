# CodeWars Project AI Assistant Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a JavaScript-focused project for solving CodeWars programming challenges. The project uses a simple HTML/JavaScript setup for testing and implementing solutions to various algorithmic problems.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the basic HTML structure and styling for the project interface
- `script.js`: Main JavaScript file where problem solutions are implemented

## Development Patterns

### Problem Implementation Pattern
Each problem in `script.js` follows this structure:
1. Problem description in comments, including:
   - Problem requirements
   - Input/output examples
   - Any constraints or edge cases
2. Implementation code below the description
3. Test cases with sample inputs

Example from `script.js`:
```javascript
/* Problem 1: 
Write a function that takes an array of numbers and a target number...
twoSum([1, 2, 3], 4) returns [0, 2] or [2, 0]
*/
```

### Testing Workflow
1. Solutions can be tested directly in the browser
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Use browser's developer console (F12) to view outputs and test results

## Best Practices
1. Use 'strict mode' as indicated at the start of `script.js`
2. Keep solutions modular and self-contained
3. Include example test cases in comments above each solution

## Development Setup
1. No build process required - direct browser execution
2. Problems can be solved and tested with vanilla JavaScript
3. Browser console used for debugging and viewing results

## Getting Started
1. Add new problem descriptions as comments in `script.js`
2. Implement solution below the problem description
3. Test in browser using the console

Note: This project is focused on algorithmic problem-solving rather than application development, so keep solutions concise and focused on the specific problem requirements.
